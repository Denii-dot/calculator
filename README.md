# Calculator application

This project was created with [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is my own application which uses bem-css-modules, sass, redux, redux-toolkit, typescript. This application was a clone of a Windows calculator. In the future, I am going to add animations and connect Firebase to save the results. Project to view [here] (https://gleeful-faloodeh-8f2ab0.netlify.app/).
